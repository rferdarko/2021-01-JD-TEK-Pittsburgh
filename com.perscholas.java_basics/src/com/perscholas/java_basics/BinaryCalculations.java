        Write a program that declares an integer a variable x and assigns the value 2 to it and prints out the binary
        string version of the number ( Integer.toBinaryString(x) ). Now, use the left shift operator (<<) to shift
        by 1 and assign the result to x. Before printing the results, write a comment with the predicted decimal
        value and binary string. Now, print out x in decimal form and in binary notation.
        Do the preceding exercise with the following values:
        9
        17
        88
        Write a program that declares a variable x and assigns 150 to it and prints out the binary string version
        of the number. Now use the right shift operator (>>) to shift by 2 and assign the result to x. Write a
        comment indicating what you anticipate the decimal and binary values to be. Now print the value of x and
        the binary string. Do the preceding exercise with the following values:
        225
        1555
        32456
        Write a program that declares 3 int variables x, y, and z. Assign 7 to x and 17 to y. Write a comment that
        indicates what you predict will be the result of the bitwise & operation on x and y. Now use the bitwise &
        operator to derive the decimal and binary values and assign the result to z. Now, with the preceding values,
        use the bitwise | operator to calculate the “or” value between x and y. As before, write a comment that
        indicates what you predict the values to be before printing them out.
        Write a program that declares an integer variable, assigns a number, and uses a postfix increment operator
        to increase the value. Print the value before and after the increment operator.
        Write a program that demonstrates at least 3 ways to increment a variable by 1 and does this multiple times.
        Assign a value to an integer variable, print it, increment by 1, print it again, increment by 1, and then
        print again.
        Write a program that declares 2 integer variables, x, and y, and then assigns 5 to x and 8 to y. Create
        another variable sum and assign the value of ++x added to y and print the result. Notice the value of
        the sum (should be 14). Now change the increment operator to postfix (x++) and re-run the program.
        Notice what the value of sum is. The first configuration incremented x and then calculated the sum while
        the second configuration calculated the sum and then incremented x.
